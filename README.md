# Reinforcement-Learning-Traffic-Control-System
This project implements a reinforcement learning-based traffic signal control system using SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) traffic simulator. The system uses computer vision and deep reinforcement learning techniques to optimize traffic flow at an intersection.
